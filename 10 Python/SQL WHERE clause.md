#SQL 
Note, unlike in Python, in a [[SQL]] `WHERE` clause we use a single equal sign to indicate a test for equality rather than a double equal sign. Other logical operations allowed in a `WHERE` clause include `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, as well as `AND` and `OR` and parentheses to build your logical expressions.
