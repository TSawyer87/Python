Why DRY Matters:

*Reduced Errors*: Errors happen when you copy and paste code. DRY helps maintain code integrity.

*Easier Maintenance*:  Modifying a single function that is used in multiple places is much simpler than tracking and updating in multiple places.

*Improved Readability*:  Easier to understand because it is less redundant.
