[[SQLite]] 
- is a self-contained, lightweight database management system (DBMS). It's a library written in C that implements the core database functionality, including data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

- **Standalone:** SQLite can operate independently, without requiring a separate database server process. This makes it ideal for situations where a full-fledged server setup is unnecessary.
**Python `sqlite3`

**

**Module:**

- **Interface for Python:** The `sqlite3` module is a Python library that acts as an interface between your Python code and the SQLite database engine. It provides functions and classes that allow you to:
    - Create connections to SQLite databases (files)
    - Execute SQL queries to interact with the data
    - Fetch results from queries
    - Manage transactions (committing or rolling back changes)

**Relationship:**

- **Interaction Layer:** Think of `sqlite3` as a bridge or translator between your Python program and the underlying SQLite database engine. It allows you to use Python syntax and functions to interact with the database using SQL commands.
- **Shared Core:** Both the `sqlite3` module and the standalone SQLite library ultimately rely on the same core SQLite engine for data storage and processing. The data itself is stored in the same format, regardless of whether you access it through Python or directly with tools like the `sqlite3` command-line utility.

**In essence, the `sqlite3` module provides a convenient way for Python programs to interact with SQLite databases. They work together seamlessly, with `sqlite3` offering a Python-specific interface to the core functionalities of the SQLite database engine.**
