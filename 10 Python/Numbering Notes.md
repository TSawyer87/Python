“The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of **giving them fixed numbers**. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to **identify each note permanently**.”

- “If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he **added it directly behind the previous note**. If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. **By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked.** For example, a note about causality and systems theory carried the number 21/3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/3d7a6.”
- “Luhmann would **add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index** (Schmidt 2013, 171). The reason he was so economical with notes per keyword and why we too should be very selective lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as **a system to think with**, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for – we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But **liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place**.”
