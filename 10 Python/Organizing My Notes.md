#Obsidian 
Understanding fleeting and permanent notes has been _huge_ for me. I love taking fleeting notes on the go, when I’m reading or listening to something that I want to remember. At any given time I have 10-50 fleeting notes in my vault, but every day I try to refactor at least a few of them, so that I don’t lose the original idea. Converting fleeting notes to robust _permanent_ notes is satisfying, so it’s a chore I do willingly.

If you struggle to figure out what notes to link to other notes, then you might want to look into [MOCs](https://obsidian.rocks/maps-of-content-effortless-organization-for-notes/ "MOCs"), or _Maps of Content_. This is another concept that I’ve found useful: all of my permanent notes ultimately link to a _MOC_, which allows me to keep things more organized. Since Luhmann had physical notes, he was able to order things _physically_, and place notes in a logical sequence. That is one thing that we don’t have in the digital realm: you can’t place similar notes sequentially _next to_ each other. I find that MOCs help bridge that gap, and allow you to group related notes together with little fuss or mess.

If you’re using Obsidian for your Zettelkasten, you can also [automate the creation of MOCs](https://obsidian.rocks/quick-tip-quickly-organize-notes-in-obsidian/), or [create a graph of newly created notes](https://obsidian.rocks/a-graph-for-zettelkasten-measuring-growth-in-obsidian/).

## Summary

We’ve gone through all the details above, but here’s a quick summary of how I do Zettelkasten in Obsidian:

- Find an idea, create a fleeting note in my “Fleeting” folder (dedicated to just fleeting notes)
- Hours or days later, go through fleeting notes. Rewrite the original idea, create new notes for new ideas if needed, and link related ideas together
- Move permanent notes out of the Fleeting folder, into my permanent notes folder
- As time goes on, connect more and more ideas to the original idea

Ultimately it’s a simple idea that has profound results. The more ideas you add to your permanent notes, the more valuable it makes all your _other_ notes.
