#SQL 
To remove a row, you need a `WHERE` clause on an [[SQL]] `DELETE` statement. The `WHERE` clause determines which rows are to be deleted:

```
DELETE FROM Track WHERE title = 'My Way'
```

These four basic SQL commands (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE) allow the four basic operations needed to create and maintain data. We use “[[CRUD]]” (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to capture all these concepts in a single term.[2](https://www.py4e.com/html3/15-database#fn2)
