#SQL
Structured Query Language: 
**[[Relational Database]] Focus:**

- SQL works primarily with relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and columns represent specific attributes (fields) of that record.
- **Structured Language:** It uses a defined set of keywords and syntax to perform various operations on data. These operations are typically phrased as questions or requests, making it relatively easy to learn compared to general-purpose programming languages.

**How is SQL Used?**

SQL serves as the primary tool for interacting with relational databases. Here are some core functionalities it provides:

- **Data Manipulation:**
    - **SELECT:** Retrieving data from one or more tables based on specific criteria. This is the most fundamental operation in SQL, allowing you to extract the information you need.
    - **INSERT:** Adding new records to a table.
    - **UPDATE:** Modifying existing data within a table.
    - **DELETE:** Removing records from a table.
- **Data Definition:**
    - **CREATE:** Defining the structure of new databases, tables, or other database objects. This includes specifying data types for each column.
    - **ALTER:** Modifying the structure of existing tables, such as adding or removing columns.
    - **DROP:** Removing databases, tables, or other database objects.
- **Data Control:**
    - **GRANT:** Assigning permissions to users or groups, controlling who can access and manipulate data in the database.
    - **REVOKE:** Taking away previously granted permissions.

**Beyond the Basics:**

- **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables based on relationships between them. This is crucial for extracting meaningful insights from relational databases.
- **Aggregation:** Performing calculations on groups of data, such as finding the average, minimum, or maximum values in a column.
- **Subqueries:** Embedding queries within other queries for more complex data retrieval scenarios.
- **Stored Procedures:** Creating reusable blocks of SQL statements to streamline database operations and improve code maintainability.
