#Functions
The `abs()` function in Python is a built-in function used to compute the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.

**Here's how the `abs()` function works:**

- You pass a numerical value (integer, float, or complex number) as an argument to the function.
- The function returns the non-negative version of that number.

**Examples:**

Python

```python
# Positive numbers
abs(10)        # Output: 10
abs(3.14)      # Output: 3.14

# Negative numbers
abs(-5)        # Output: 5
abs(-3.14)     # Output: 3.14

# Complex numbers (absolute value of the magnitude)
abs(complex(3, 4))  # Output: 5.0 (magnitude of the complex number)
```
