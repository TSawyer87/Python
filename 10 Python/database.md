#Database

Since it is on permanent storage it can store far more than other python [[data structures]]. Database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing or data very fast similar to a python [[dictiionary]].


Database software maintains its performance by building [[indexes]] as data is added to allow the computer to quickly jump to a particular entry.

[[SQLite]] is a very common database and already built into Python.
